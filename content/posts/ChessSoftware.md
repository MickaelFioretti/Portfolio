# Chess Software

I have developed this project using Python and the basic for good practices.

## Description

This is a project from the Python course on OpenClassrooms. The goal is to create a tournament manager for chess. The user can create tournaments and players. He can also add the results of the matches. The software will calculate the ranking of the players.
