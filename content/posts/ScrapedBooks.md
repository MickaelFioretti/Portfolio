# Scraped Books

I have developed this project using Python and the BeautifulSoup library. I have also used the requests library to get the HTML code of the website.

## Description

This is a project from the Python course on OpenClassrooms. The goal is to scrape the website [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/) and to save the data in a CSV file.

### The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MickaelFioretti/ScrapedBooks)
