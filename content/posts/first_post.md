# First web project

## Memory Game

This is a memory game. The player has to find all the pairs of cards. The game ends when all the pairs are found.

### Description

I have developed this game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In the previous formation, I have learned the basics of these languages. I have also learned how to use the Bootstrap framework. I have used it to make the game responsive.
