# JustStreamIt

I have developed the frontend of this project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I don't have used any framework.

## Description

This is a project from the Python course on OpenClassrooms. The goal is to create a website to watch the best movies. The user can see the list of the best movies and the details of each movie.

### The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MickaelFioretti/JustStreamIt)
